#### Technologies In Use
A mobile-responsive portfolio site built using modern design practices and deployed via Netlify. GitHub Webhooks have been used to create a CI/CD software development lifecyle for any future feature request or site enhancements. Currently working on creating a Gatbsy v4 template out of the theme for others to use for their own portfolio site.
