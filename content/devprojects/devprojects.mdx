## <Underlining> WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT </Underlining>

My experience centers around developing solutions for WaaS/SaaS businesses. My time in the tech industry has allowed me to take part in building dashboard/admin panel interfaces, API and cloud database integration systems, UI/UX and graphic design projects. By providing secure and efficient contributions to both development department operations and the end-user experience, my skillset has matured to a point of passion.

## <Underlining> IT SUPPORT AND QUALITY ASSURANCE </Underlining>

Having been afforded the opportunity to work for development teams of all sizes, I have honed in on the skillset necessary to address both internal development issues and client-facing ones.

## <Underlining> UI/UX DESIGN AND RAPID PROTOTYPING </Underlining>

Through extensive design meetings with UI/UX teams and attempting to meet the needs of an ever increasing SEO checklist for the modern web, I have grown proficient in both rapid prototyping and wireframing.

## <Underlining> OPEN TO OPPORTUNITY </Underlining>

Currently I am working on a number of web applications that aid in help-desk operations, account management, data protection and content management. I am comfortable with a wide range of web technologies, but particularly enjoy front-end software development. I blog about a wide range of topics relating to emerging technology, programming concepts, data aggregation, and entrepreneurship. I am open to and looking for exciting new development projects to contribute to!
