## <Underlining> WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT </Underlining>

I have been a part of a number of development teams focused on delivering WaaS/SaaS products and services. As an individual contributor to small and large development teams, I took part in designing admin panel/dashboard layouts, converting brand style guides into reusable design components, implementing test driven development strategies on UI/UX conflicts, and developing automated support ticket solutions for improved help desk management.

## <Underlining> IT SUPPORT AND QUALITY ASSURANCE </Underlining>

An often overlooked aspect of the software development life-cycle is how to maintain your product or service post launch. This includes effectively and efficiently handling end-user satisfaction; as well as delivering a certain quality standard that your products and services can be known for. My time spent working with support personnel in developer operations afforded me the experience of utilizing test driven design practices in development, working with UI/UX responsive testing frameworks for cross-device support, and handling regular client interactions to increase product penetration and customer retention.

## <Underlining> UI/UX DESIGN AND RAPID PROTOTYPING </Underlining>

Through extensive design meetings with UI/UX teams and attempting to meet the needs of an ever increasing SEO checklist for the modern web, I have grown proficient in rapid prototyping for web and mobile applications. After working with a number of design tools I have found my workflow to be most efficient in Figma. From creating team libraries to developing interactive frames to illustrate real-world functionality, my skill set has provided me with a creative approach to working with UI/UX. Incorporating responsiveness, modularity, and reusability into my design practices has only made me a better designer throughout my time in the industry.

## <Underlining> OPEN TO OPPORTUNITY </Underlining>

Currently I am working on a number of web applications that aid in help-desk operations, account management, data protection and content management. I am comfortable with a wide range of web technologies, but particularly enjoy front-end software development. I blog about a wide range of topics relating to emerging technology, programming concepts, data aggregation, and entrepreneurship. I am open to and looking for exciting new development projects to contribute to!
