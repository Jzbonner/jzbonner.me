import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I want to use my software engineering skillset to contribute to the technological landscapes of tomorrow. Inspired by my studies at UNC Chapel Hill -- where I was heavily exposed to the principles of information retrieval, data management and web application development -- I have sought out opportunities that allowed me to grow my talent in both a professional sense and as a passion.

Having had first hand experience with moderate to large scale web app development life cycles, my employment background has allowed me to be a contributor on engineering teams of all sizes. Typically my responsibilities have included optimizing support ticket efficiency, adding data-enriched features to admin dashboards, and creating SEO-focused modern front-end layouts.

The experiences I gained working at <Underlining>**a multinational technology
conglomerate**</Underlining>, <Underlining>**a digital advertising
agency**</Underlining>, and <Underlining>**a number of startups**</Underlining>,
have empowered me with the tools and resources necessary to provide web-services
and technologies that benefit the end user and instill lasting company impact.
