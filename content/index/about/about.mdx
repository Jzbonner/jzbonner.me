import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

Learning to bridge the gap between technology and usability is an important
skill that I was able to develop during my time at the University of North
Carolina - CH, and through my employment experiences in tech. 

With an academic background based in information retrieval, data organization,
and human computer interaction; my passion for technology has enabled me to
build web-app focused projects that aid in help-desk operations, account
management, data protection, and content management. 

The experiences I gained working at <Underlining>**a multinational technology
conglomerate**</Underlining>, <Underlining>**a digital advertising
agency**</Underlining>, and <Underlining>**a number of startups**</Underlining>,
have empowered me with the tools and resources necessary to provide web-services
and technologies that benefit the end user and instill lasting company impact.
